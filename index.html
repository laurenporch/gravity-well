<h2>Gravity Well</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Navigate through puzzles made more difficult by gravity that changes!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Making their brain hurt by forcing them to think differently.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Puzzle platformer.
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player can push objects to move them into position before the gravity changes in the room. Objects fall in the same direction as the player, and if they fall far enough then they explode. If done correctly, the player can maneuver objects to stack, block each other, or explode in order to reach the exit.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
Discover if the core mechanic is unique and challenging enough to warrant further development.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Players must place objects just so in order to get them into position when the gravity changes. The gravity mechanics will make them think in unique ways.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
A spaceship on a long journey through the galaxy.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You are an ambassador sent to meet with the first intelligent alien life humanity has ever encountered. You were blissfully unaware of the long journey through the galaxy until your ship’s emergency system woke you from cryo-sleep. The ship’s gravity well compartment was hit by an asteroid and it’s messing with the gravity all over the ship. This is terrible! How would it look to the aliens if you arrived with a broken ship that couldn’t maintain consistent gravity? They’d think humans were entirely incompetent! There’s nothing for it: you must make your way to the gravity well and try to repair the damage with what you have on hand. You’re too far away to turn back now, and that would be too embarrassing to explain anyway. You’re no gravity mechanic, but your cousin Sam is one, so it can’t be that hard to figure out, right?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Everyone ages 8+
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
1~2 minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Knowing your path before starting to move so that you can make the best use of each gravity shift.
</li>
